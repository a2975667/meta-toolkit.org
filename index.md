## MeTA is a modern C++ data sciences toolkit featuring

 - text tokenization, including deep semantic features like parse trees
 - inverted and forward indexes with compression and various caching strategies
 - a collection of ranking functions for searching the indexes
 - topic models
 - classification algorithms
 - graph algorithms
 - language models
 - CRF implementation (POS-tagging, shallow parsing)
 - wrappers for liblinear and libsvm (including libsvm dataset parsers)
 - UTF8 support for analysis on various languages
 - multithreaded algorithms
